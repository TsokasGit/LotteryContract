# LotteryContract
A simple lottery contract made in solidity for a uni project.

The base concept is that people will be buying "Tokens" for ETHER. Once a person has a token, he can make a bidding on the lottery. The owner of the contract can then pick a random bidder out of the pool and transfer the contract's balance to the winner.
